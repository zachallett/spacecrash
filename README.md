Spacecrash
==========

A public repo built on Mac OSX following [**Designing a one week game**](http://jonbho.net/2013/08/25/spacecrash-designing-a-one-week-game/) created by [**John Beltran de Heredia**](http://jonbho.net/about/). 

Each day in the guide will have its branch, so it will be easy to follow along. The master branch will be the final product of spacecrash.

## Setup
You will need to have GLFW installed. To install easily via brew, do

```brew install homebrew/versions/glfw2```

You can also install GLFW from source, however per the environment setup, you need to have GLFW 2.X installed.

Clone the repository locally via ```git clone```

``` git clone git@github.com:zhallett/spacecrash.git```

```cd spacecrash && open scosx/scosx.xcodeproj```
